// /area rename — let whoever is running a room name it after what is actually
// happening in it. A CM sets up a Danganronpa case in "Courtroom 3" and the
// area list still says "Courtroom 3"; /area rename DR Killing Game makes the
// list say what the room is.
//
// It is a LOAN, not a transfer. The configured name in areas.toml is the area's
// real identity, and it comes back the moment the room stops belonging to
// anyone -- when the last person leaves, or when the last CM does. That is what
// keeps a rename from being a way to permanently vandalise the server's area
// list: nobody has to remember to undo one, and there is no state to clean up
// after an operator restarts.
//
// The name reaches every connected client, so it goes through the same tiered
// word list that IC and OOC messages do (see automod.go), nuke tier included.
