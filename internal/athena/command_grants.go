// Account-based per-command permission grants.
//
// The server's role system (roles.toml -> permission bitfield) is coarse:
// every command behind a given bit (MUTE, BAN, ADMIN, ...) opens up together.
// That is the right shape for a moderator, but it has no way to say "this one
// account may run /ban and nothing else" without also handing over BAN's
// other ~15 commands, or inventing a new role and a new bit for every such
// request.
//
// ACCOUNT_COMMAND_GRANTS is a second, independent axis alongside that bitfield:
// a console operator (shell/VPS access to the box, not anything reachable
// in-game) can grant one specific command to one specific account by username
// -- the "hundreds of account usernames" already created via /register or
// /mkusr -- without changing that account's role at all. A grant is checked
// purely by command name and only ever adds access on top of whatever the
// account's role already allows; it can never take access away, and it does
// not touch client.perms (so IsModerator/IsAdmin/IsShadow, shadow-mod
// anonymization, DisplayModName, and every other role-based behavior stay
// exactly as they were for a granted account -- it is still a plain player
// or a plain moderator in every other respect, just one that can also run
// this one extra command).
//
// This deliberately mirrors the account-based (not role-based) shape the
// rest of the account system already uses: /createtag, /grantcustomtag,
// /musicban and friends are all keyed by account, not by a bit added to
// roles.toml. It reuses the exact same USERS table both moderator accounts
// (/mkusr) and player accounts (/register) share, so the same mechanism
// covers both "give a plain registered player the ability to /ban someone"
// and "give a moderator who doesn't have BAN a couple of admin commands
// without promoting them to admin" -- both are just a username with a grant.
//
// Granting is console-only, matching the precedent set by the removed
// `grant` console gate (see "Removed: Console-Gated Commands" in CLAUDE.md):
// a capability this broad -- literally any command in the registry, aimed at
// any of potentially hundreds of accounts -- belongs behind shell access to
// the box, not an in-game command any moderator could reach.
