// cmdReload (/reload) hot-reloads every supported config/data file from disk
// without restarting the server. ADMIN only.
//
// Reloaded files (atomic, race-safe — see livereload.go):
//
//   - characters.txt     (append-only; insert/reorder/rename requires restart)
//   - music.txt
//   - cdns.txt
//   - backgrounds.txt
//   - parrot.txt
//   - 8ball.txt          (optional; missing file leaves current value intact)
//   - banned_words.txt   (only when automod is enabled)
//   - config.toml        (motd and description only)
//
// Areas, listener ports, rate-limit windows, roles and the server name are NOT
// reloaded — those require a restart because they're snapshotted into other
// structures at startup.
