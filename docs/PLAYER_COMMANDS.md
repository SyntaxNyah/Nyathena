## General / Movement

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/area <name>` | Move to a named area |
| `/areas` | List all areas |
| `/areainfo` | Show settings for the current area |
| `/areadesc` | Show this area's entry description |
| `/ga` | List players in your current area |
| `/gas` | List players in **all** areas (empty areas are hidden) |
| `/players` | Same as /ga |
| `/find <name>` | Find which area a player is in |
| `/pos [pos]` | Show or set your IC position (def, pro, wit, jud, hld, hlp) |
| `/charselect` | Return to character select |
| `/move [-u <uids>] <area>` | Move to an area (the `-u` form needs `MOVE_USERS`) |

| `/dc` / `/dctime [minutes\|off\|status]` | **Opt-in** idle auto-disconnect that affects **only you** — no number arms a 1-hour timer. Any IC or OOC message resets the countdown. Off by default; `/dctime off` cancels. |

| `/kickother` | Kick stale ghost connections sharing your HDID |

---

## Chat

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/global <message>` (or `/g`) | Send a server-wide OOC message. Shows your `[tag]` like local OOC. Filtered exactly like ordinary chat. |
| `/pm <uid> <message>` | Private message a specific player |
| `/ignore <uid>` / `/ignore list` | Permanently ignore a player (survives reconnects), or list who you're ignoring. Real moderators and admins cannot be ignored; shadow mods can. |

| `/erp` | Toggle the area's ERP mode (if allowed) |
| `/8ball <question>` | Ask the Magic 8-Ball. Answers come from `8ball.txt` or a built-in classic list. |
| `/translate <text> <language>` | Translate text with DeepL (25-second cooldown) |
| `/getmusic` | Show the URL of the song playing in this area and re-send the MC packet to just you (handy when your client's audio bugged out). |
| `/randomsong` | Play a random track. Tiered cooldown: 20s for players, 5s for DJs, none for mods. |
| `/vlist` | List the voice-chat participants in your area (servers with `enable_voice`) |

---

## Pairing

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/pair <uid>` | Request to pair with a player. Mutual `/pair` finalizes the pairing. Messages reference each player's **showname** (in-character name) when set. |
| `/unpair` | Cancel your pair. Full bidirectional reset — clears state on every peer that referenced you, so no desyncs. |
| `/lfp` | Toggle your **Looking-For-Pair** flag. Flagged players show up in `/pairlist`. |
| `/pairlist` | List everyone in your area flagged `/lfp`, with UID, name and character — then `/pair <uid>` away. |

| `/cvote <action> <uid> [reason]` | Community moderation vote (kick/mute/ban/warn/areakick). Moderators have the final say. |

---

## Running a room (area CM)

`/cm` makes you a **case manager** for the area you are standing in — no moderator role required, as long as the area allows CMs. Everything below is then available to you (and to moderators, who hold the same `CM` permission everywhere).

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/cm [uids]` | Become an area CM (or promote others) |
| `/uncm [uids]` | Step down (or demote others) |
| **`/area rename <name>`** | **Name the room you are in** — `/area rename DR Killing Game`. See below. |
| **`/area unrename`** | Put the configured name back straight away |
| `/area mute` / `/area unmute` | Silence everyone in the room except CMs and moderators (IC and OOC), and lift it. Scoped to the room: leaving the area lifts it automatically. |
| `/lock` / `/unlock` | Lock the area (current occupants are auto-invited) |
| `/lock -s` | Set the area spectatable |
| `/spectate [invite\|uninvite <uids>]` | Toggle spectate mode — everyone may enter and watch, only CMs and invited players may speak IC. Listed in `/help` for every player so anyone can look up what it does. |
| `/invite <uids>` / `/uninvite <uids>` | Grant or revoke entry in a locked area, and IC speaking rights in spectate mode |
| `/kickarea <uids>` | Eject players from the area (they also drop off the invite list, so they cannot walk back in) |
| `/forcepos <uids\|all> <position>` | Stage a scene: push players in your area into a courtroom position |
| `/status <idle\|lfp\|casing\|recess\|rp\|gaming>` | Set the area status shown on the area list (`lfp` is short for `looking-for-players`) |
| `/evimode <any\|cms\|mods>` | Set who may edit evidence |
| `/randombg` | Random background from the server list (once every 5s) |
| `/musiclock` | Restrict music changes to CMs and moderators |
| `/poll [question]\|[option]\|[option]...` | Open a poll in the area |
| `/togglerandompunish` | Toggle the area's random-punishment rolls |

### Naming your room — `/area rename`

```
/area rename DR Killing Game     # the area list now reads "DR Killing Game"
/area rename                     # show the current name and the configured one
/area unrename                   # restore the configured name right now
```

The rename reaches everyone who is already connected — nobody has to reconnect to see it.

**It is a loan.** The name in the server's `areas.toml` is the area's real identity, and it comes back on its own when the room stops belonging to anyone:

- the **last person leaves** the area, or
- the area **loses its last CM** — they ran `/uncm`, moved elsewhere, or disconnected.

So you never have to remember to undo one, and a restart returns every area to its configured name.

**Names are checked before they are accepted:** 1–32 characters, no `#`, `%`, `$` or `&` (AO2 spends those on its packet format), no control characters, not the same as a music track or another area's name, and it goes through the same banned-word filter as IC and OOC chat — including the same evasion-resistant matching and the same consequences. A room name is shown to every connected player, so it is held to exactly the standard a line of chat is.

## Accounts (when accounts/casino are enabled)

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/register <username> <password>` | Create a free player account. Captcha confirmation required by default. |

| `/playtime top <page>` | Browse subsequent pages of 25 |
| `/resetusername <new>` | Rename your account (keeps playtime/chips/wardrobe). Capped at **3 renames per account**. |

---

## Punishment Self-Service

## Notes

- **Permission gating**: Everything in this guide is callable by every connected player, except the "Running a room" section, which needs the `CM` permission — and `/cm` hands that to any player in an area that allows CMs.
- Moderator-only commands (mute, kick, ban, the punishment commands, `/firewall`, `/lockdown`, etc.) are documented in `MOD_COMMANDS.md`.
- **Cooldowns**: Many commands have small per-user cooldowns. The 5s `/randomchar` cooldown is bypassed for DJs and moderators.
- **Tags in OOC**: Local OOC and `/global` both show your equipped tag in front of your name as `[Tag] Name`.
