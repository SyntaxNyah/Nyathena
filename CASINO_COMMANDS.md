# Casino Commands — Nyathena Chips

This document covers the full casino system, including **Nyathena Chips** (the server's virtual currency), all casino games, leaderboards, and staff configuration commands.

---

## Nyathena Chips

**Nyathena Chips** are a persistent virtual currency tied to your IPID (connection fingerprint).

- Every new connection starts with **500 chips** automatically.
- Balances persist across sessions.
- Chips cannot go negative — you can only spend what you have.
- **Maximum balance: 10,000,000 chips (10 million).** Winnings are capped at this ceiling to prevent runaway inflation.
- **Default maximum bet: 10,000,000 chips (10 million)** per wager when no area-specific limit is configured. Staff can raise or lower this per-area with `/casinoset maxbet`.

### 🔒 Password Security

Player account passwords are stored using **bcrypt** (industry-standard one-way hashing at cost factor 12). Your password is **never stored in plain text** — not in the database, not in logs, and never transmitted after initial registration. Even server administrators cannot read your password.

---

### 🔴 European Roulette — `/croulette`

```
/croulette bet <type> <amount>
```

| Bet Type | Description | Payout |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| `red` | Red numbers | 1:1 |
| `black` | Black numbers | 1:1 |
| `even` | Even numbers (not 0) | 1:1 |
| `odd` | Odd numbers | 1:1 |
| `low` | Numbers 1–18 | 1:1 |

| `number <n>` | Straight up (0–36) | 35:1 |

**Example:**
```
/croulette bet red 100
/croulette bet number 17 50
```

---

### 🎴 Baccarat — `/baccarat`

```
/baccarat <player|banker|tie> <amount>
```

| Bet | Payout |
|-----|--------|
| `player` | 1:1 |
| `banker` | 0.95:1 (5% commission) |
| `tie` | 8:1 |

---

### 🎲 Craps (Lite) — `/craps`

```
/craps bet <pass|nopass> <amount>
```

**Pass line rules:**
- First roll 7 or 11: **pass wins**.
- First roll 2, 3, or 12: **pass loses** (craps out).
- Any other number becomes the **point**; keep rolling until point repeats (pass wins) or 7 appears (pass loses).

Pass pays **1:1**; don't-pass is the opposite outcome.

---

### 📈 Crash — `/crash`

Bet before launch, then cash out before the multiplier crashes.

```
/crash bet <amount>   — start a round with a bet
/crash cashout        — cash out at the current multiplier
```

- The multiplier grows every second starting at 1.05×.
- The game crashes at a random point between 1.05× and 6×, skewed **very** heavily toward lower values (four-random-product distribution).
- **House edge: 20%** — all payouts are multiplied by 0.80.
- If you don't `/crash cashout` before the crash, you lose your bet.

**⚠️ Anti-cheese rules (no more instant-cashout spam):**
- **Minimum hold time: 5 seconds** — you cannot cash out within the first 5 seconds after betting. Attempting to do so counts as a loss ("rocket explodes on the launchpad").
- **45-second cooldown between bets** — after a round ends (win or lose), you must wait 45 seconds before starting a new crash game.

---

### 💣 Mines — `/mines`

Navigate a minefield for increasing multipliers.

```
/mines start <mines> <bet>  — start a game (1–24 mines on 5×5 grid)
/mines pick <n>             — reveal cell n (1–25)
/mines cashout              — collect your current winnings
/mines quit                 — give up (lose your bet)
```

- Each safe pick increases your multiplier.
- Hitting a mine ends the game and you lose your bet.
- The more mines, the higher the potential multiplier per pick.

---

### 🎱 Keno — `/keno`

Pick numbers and hope they match the draw.

```
/keno pick <n1> <n2> ... <bet>
```

- Pick 1–10 numbers from 1–80.
- 20 numbers are drawn randomly.
- Payout scales by how many of your picks match (the more picks you make, the higher the jackpot for matching all of them).

**Example:**
```
/keno pick 7 14 21 28 35 100
```

---

### 🎡 Prize Wheel — `/wheel`

```
/wheel spin <bet>
```

**Wheel segments (casino-realistic odds, ~92.5% RTP):**

| Multiplier | Probability |
|------------|-------------|
| 0× (miss)  | 60% |
| 1.5×       | 17% |
| 2×         | 13% |
| 3×         | 7%  |
| 5×         | 2%  |
| 10×        | 1%  |

---

```
/gamble hide
```

- Run once to **hide** all gambling result announcements (wheel spins, slot wins, roulette results, etc.) from your chat.
- Run again to **show** them again.
- This setting is saved to your account and automatically restored when you log in.

---

### 🍻 The Bar — `/bar`

Visit the bar for drinks with **massive variance** — every drink carries real risk of a big loss or a big gain. No safe options here!

```
/bar menu              — show all available drinks with costs
/bar buy <drink>       — order a drink (costs chips, rolls a random effect)

## Earning Chips Without Gambling

Beyond casino games, there are two non-gambling ways to earn chips.

### 🔤 Unscramble Events

Every **30 minutes to 3 hours** (random) the server posts a scrambled word to all players via OOC broadcast. The **first player to type the correct unscrambled word in IC chat** wins **10 chips**. Once a player claims the reward, the round ends immediately and the server waits for the next scheduled interval before posting a new puzzle.

- Puzzles expire after **5 minutes** if nobody answers.
- The prize is fixed at 10 chips per event.
- Words are drawn from a large, varied pool — no two consecutive rounds use the same word.
- The winner's **typing speed** is recorded and announced to the server.
- Wins are tracked per account for a dedicated leaderboard.
- If you register/login and your IPID changes, your unscramble wins are **automatically merged** onto your new connection — you never lose your score.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/unscramble` | Show your win count and the current active puzzle (if any). |
| `/unscramble top [n]` | Show the top unscramble winners (top 10 by default, max 50). |

**Example:**
```
🔤 UNSCRAMBLE EVENT! Unscramble this word in IC chat to win 10 chips!
   Scrambled: TONYETAR
   You have 5 minutes. First correct answer wins!

> (player types "attorney" in IC)
🎉 UNSCRAMBLE SOLVED! Phoenix typed "attorney" in 4.32s — +10 chips awarded!
```

---

### 💼 Jobs

Type a job command to earn chips. Each job has a **unique cooldown** and **some have random bonus chances** to keep things interesting.

| Command | Base Reward | Cooldown | Interactive Notes |
|---------|-------------|----------|-------------------|
| `/busker` | 2–6 chips | 30 min | **Random tips** (2–6 chips); performance is **announced in area OOC** so others see you! |
| `/janitor` | 3 chips | 45 min | **25% chance** to find a lost coin (+1 bonus chip). |
| `/paperboy` | 3 chips | 60 min | **15% chance** for a generous reader to tip extra (+2 bonus chips). |
| `/clerk` | 4 chips | 90 min | **15% overtime rush** chance (+2 bonus chips). |
| `/bailiffjob` | 5 chips | 2 hours | **10% chance** to catch suspicious activity (+2 bonus chips). |

Use `/jobs` to see all available jobs with their rewards and cooldowns at a glance.
Use `/jobtop` to see who has earned the most chips from jobs.

**Examples:**

## Persistence
