// hotconfig holds the small whitelist of server-config fields that are safe to
// reload at runtime without restarting the server. Only fields that are read
// under per-connection goroutines AND whose change cannot desync client state
// belong here. Anything that is snapshotted into preallocated packets, caches,
// rate-limit windows, or area structs is deliberately excluded because
// changing it mid-session leaves the server inconsistent.
//
// Currently whitelisted:
//   - Motd         : shown to clients when they finish login
//   - Desc         : shown in the PN (player-count) packet on initial handshake
//
// Explicitly NOT whitelisted (would require careful, invasive work):
//   - Name        : baked into encodedServerName and every server-to-client CT
//   - Port/Addr   : listener already bound
//   - Areas/*     : would invalidate AreaData snapshots and pre-built SM packet
//   - Rate limits : precomputed into time.Duration globals at startup
//   - max_players : clients may already be connected above any lowered cap
